Using data from the 2003–04 and 2023–24 NBA regular seasons (source: NBA API), we find that teams with higher three-point shooting percentages have significantly higher win rates in the modern era, even after controlling for two-point efficiency and shot selection proportions.
In contrast, three-point accuracy had no significant effect on win rates two decades ago.

By incorporating interaction terms between shooting metrics and era, our model captures a statistically significant shift in the marginal effect of three-point percentage, providing structural evidence that the league has entered a new “three-point era.”

While the analysis is based on observational data, this interaction design offers a quasi-causal interpretation: the impact of three-point accuracy on team success has not only become significant—it has become significantly more important over time.
