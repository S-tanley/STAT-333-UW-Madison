We use python to collect and tidy up our data, and the whole data and the preprocess code is in this 
repo(https://github.com/S-tanley/STAT-333-UW-Madison). The original date scource is https://www.nba.com, 
and we use nba_api(https://github.com/swar/nba_api) to get the data from it. Here I directly read the csv file we generated.
```{r}
mydf <- read.csv("data/1y/2004_NBA_data.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(mydf, 20)
```
Explanation of Returned Variables:

| Variable      | Description                        | Formula                                      |
|---------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `TEAM_NAME`   | Team name                          | e.g., "Lakers", "Celtics"                    |
| `WinRate`     | Win rate                           | `W / GP`: wins divided by games played       |
| `3P%`         | Three-point field goal percentage  | `FG3M / FG3A`                                |
| `2P%`         | Two-point field goal percentage    | `(FGM - FG3M) / (FGA - FG3A)`                |
| `3P_ratio`    | Proportion of 3-point attempts     | `FG3A / FGA`                                 |
| `2P_ratio`    | Proportion of 2-point attempts     | `(FGA - FG3A) / FGA`                         |

This function helps prepare the dataset for analyzing how different shooting strategies relate to team performance across seasons.

We also have other data, if you want know more, you can go to our repo.
